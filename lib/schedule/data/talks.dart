This talks takes us on a journey through the layers of the cake called "Dart". We often hear that jsonDecode is slow in Dart - can we make it faster? Where do we start?

We will look at the Dart core libraries and how they implement jsonDecode. We will take that code for a spin with a profiler and learn how to diagnose performance issues using low-level tools.''',

At Pineboards, we specialize in embedded solutions for the Raspberry Pi ecosystem, especially around PCI Express (NVMe, networking, AI Edge TPUs etc). Last year marked our venture into direct retail, pushing us from our engineering comfort zone into the realms of order fulfillment. Our journey from manual inefficiencies to streamlined processes was powered by a custom Flutter application, centralizing operations from order listing to shipping label generation.

In this session, you will discover how to implement:* Barcode Scanning Implementation: Explore the integration of hardware barcode scanners to ensure accurate order fulfillment.* Direct Printing with Flutter: Gain insights into controlling ZPL/EPL printers directly from Flutter for efficient label printing.* Kiosk Mode: Understand how to deploy a Flutter application in Kiosk mode on a custom OS image, enhancing the user interface for industrial applications.

Moreover, we'll take a look into how well Flutter behaves on the new Raspberry Pi 5 in comparison to macOS and provide a guideline for building custom hardware solutions powered by Flutter that are meant to last and work well in industrial environments.''',

If you ask a developer whether they would prefer to fix a bug or develop a new feature, there is no doubt they will select the latter.Unfortunately, bugs are part of the development cycle and are inevitable.Fortunately, there are techniques to predict and prevent them, even without running the code: with the help of static code analysis.Static code analysis is a powerful tool for finding and fixing potential errors even before compiling your code, making the cycle much faster and developers more productive. Moreover, the flexibility of this tool allows you to configure it in a way to not only control bugs but also code style and specific team practices.In this talk, we will do a deep dive into the world of static code analysis, exploring strategies on how to set it up to work best in your project, possibilities beyond `flutter_lints`, such as other libraries and 3rd party services like Dart Code Metrics, as well as what it takes to create your own custom lints for your library or app with tools such as `custom_lint`. By the end of this talk, you will be fully equipped to set up a robust static analysis system in your project and make your projects more reliable, consistent, and performant.''',

Did you know that you can actually make more accessible apps in flutter easily? If yes, why are you not doing that?

In some cases, apps are inaccessible because there is no time or budget for it, most of the time it is just because we never took the time to read up and learn about it.

In this talk, I don't want to aim at 100% accessibility, but tell you about some quick wins, you can follow without spending a lot of time on it and grow your potential audience almost for free by just knowing about it!

Just by joining this talk, you can potentially grant somebody access, who was unable to use your app before and maybe change their world!

For years, accessibility features and experiences were seen as nice to have when it came to app development. Shockingly, many developers overlook this vital aspect, inadvertently excluding a significant user base. The World Health Organization reveals that about 15% of the global population, over a billion people, live with disabilities. In a digital age, it's unjust to marginalize this substantial demographic based on abilities.

This talk emphasizes the critical role of accessibility in mobile apps. By introducing the innovative use of Gemini AI as an AI-powered code assistance tool in IDEs like VS Code, we can address these issues head-on, ensuring that apps are accessible from the outset. Gemini AI serves as a game-changer, automating the detection and correction of accessibility issues in Flutter apps.

In this talk, I want to show you how you can blur the lines between code and art using Flutter!

After a quick introduction into what creative coding is and how its visual feedback nature can be a great way to learn how to code, we’ll dive into the technical details on how Flutter can be used for that purpose. Starting from the custom painter and canvas API, and making our way into shaders and 3rd party tools and packages. Additionally, we will explore what it means to use algorithms to create Art and what happens when you bleed that art into user interfaces and experiences. Finally, with its cross platform capabilities and easy control over every pixel, we’ll answer the question of why use Flutter for this purpose in the first place.''',

Often, when we see a blur effect in designs, we just put in the values, add a backdrop widget, and copy those values, thinking it’s done. Since it’s blurry, it’s tricky to see if it’s right — but it’s “blurry,” so we move forward.

In this session, we'll dig deeper to understand what’s really going on behind the scenes with the blur effect in Flutter. We’ll use fragment shaders to try out different kinds of blurs and see the differences between them. By doing so, we can make them look just right in our designs.''',
